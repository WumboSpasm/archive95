            Archive95 is a search engine and viewer for internet material predating the Internet Archive's formation in 1996. The viewer automatically fixes non-standard markup, reimplements unsupported browser features, and redirects links to archival sites.
            <br><br>
            Data is taken from these sources:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://archive.org/details/www-dir-cd">World Wide Web Directory</a> by Jamsa Press - A webpage listing released in June 1995 as a book with a CD-ROM packed-in. The CD-ROM contains markup and browser screenshots for all 8,000+ pages listed in the book.
                <li><a href="https://cs.rit.edu/~ats/books/cd">Einblicke ins Internet</a> by Carl Hanser Verlag - A German-language CD released in October 1995 containing over 25,000 HTML, image and video files scraped from the web. It was meant to provide an offline internet experience for those who were not connected.
            </ul>
            I will try to implement material from more sources if restoring them is feasible. Data from sources such as <a href="https://archive.org/details/cdrom-riscos-risc-disc-2">RISC Disc 2</a> and <a href="https://archive.org/details/out-of-the-net">Out-Of-The-Net</a> is particularly tricky because they don't list the original URLs each file was taken from, and the data itself has been mangled in one way or another.
            <br><br>
            That being said, if you have any questions or information to share, you can contact me at seaweedmedley (at) gmail (dot) com. I am currently on the lookout for anything related to Einblicke ins Internet (such as a proper disc image), so any pointers would be appreciated.
